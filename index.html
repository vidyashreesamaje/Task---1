        <h2> What our customers say</h2>
        <p>
            “I love how organized the system is and how little time it takes to get what we need at a moment’s notice. 
            One-click and you have everything you need! We all love how easy it is to upload candidate files, use the
           pipeline, schedule interviews, etc. It takes seconds to know what is happening on each job and what stage 
           the candidates are in. Our old systems over the years were very time-consuming, and the programmers always 
           made promises they couldn’t keep, leaving us feeling taken advantage of. I’m so happy my business coach
            recommended Recruit CRM!”
